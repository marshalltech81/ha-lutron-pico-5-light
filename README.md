PyScript Home Assistant Lutron 5 Button Pico Remote Controller for Lights

## Motivation

I have many Lutron 5 Button Pico remotes controlling many lights in Home 
Assistant. It became duplicitous attempting to use Home Assistant Blueprints 
and thus this PyScript was born. I wanted one config and one script to control 
my lighting setup such that if I wanted to change its functionality, I only had 
to do it in one place.
